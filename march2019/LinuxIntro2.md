#  Devops Essentials Mdodule 1 [ March 2019]

This guide provides simple practical steps to learning and using Linux. It will take about an hour to complete

---

## 

You will try out different Linux commands to  solve real life problems as a way of familiarising yourself with the environment.

---

## Intended Audience

Users who undertand basic concept of the computer system.

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following is installed and working

- putty https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cho8pwn3tlfz37o/AADcF15c1vXwVhu4LE23BkVIa?dl=0 
- set it up as directed by the instructor

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THESE ARE PRESENT**

---

## Getting started

- Make sure you can login and have access to shared Linux server and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php

###  Task 1: System Info: You have been asked to provide the following information of the node that has just been provisioned

- Linux Type, version and kernel number 
- Name, IP address, number of network card (interface) 
- How long it has been up 
- System start, stop, crash history
- Determine if you are running out of space on the system
- Number of users currently connected to the machine
- Check how much memory is on the system and how much is used and free.
- Check the number of CPUs on the system and its details 

#### Linux Type, version and kernel number

    cat /etc/*release*
    uname -r ; uname -a

#### Name, IP address, number of network card (interface) and how long it has been up

    hostname ; uname -n
    ip address ; ifconfig


#### How long it has been up 

    uptime -s

#### System start, stop, crash history

    last

#### Determine if you are running out of space on the system 

    df -h

#### Number of users currently connected to the machine

    who -u

####   Check how much memory is on the system and how much is used and free

    free -m .You can also try cat /proc/meminfo

#### Check the number of CPUs on the system and its details
    lscpu



### Task 2. Working with shortcut keys.

- working with tab key
- working with reverse search key
- working with ! key 

### Task 3. Navigating across the system

Note: Now that we are familiar with some of Linux commands, let's explore navigating and creating directories ( and files)

- determine your current location on the system
- go to your home directory and confirm you are in your home directory.
- go back to where you were before getting your home directory
- go to your home directory and confirm you are in your home directory.
- create a directory called `events and  go into the the directory
- create `2016` directory in `events`
- Now create Jan-Mar, and  1..7 directories in `2016`.
- Now list all the directories created.
- Determine the absolute directory of `Jan` directory.

####  Determine your current location on the system
        pwd

####  Go to your home directory and confirm you are in your home directory.
        cd ~  Note: you could also use cd
        pwd
####  Go back to where you were before getting your home directory.
        cd  
        pwd
####  Go to your home directory and confirm you are in your home directory. 
        cd ~  Note: you could also use cd
        pwd

####  Create a directory called `events`and go into the directory
        mkdir events
        cd events

####  Create `2019` directory in `events`
        mkdir 2019

####  Create Jan-Mar ( or 1-12) directories in `2019` : 
        cd 2019
        mkdir Jan 
        mkdir Feb 
        mkdir Mar 


####  Create 1..7 directories in `2019` : 
        pwd  . To ensure  you are still in `2019` directory
        mkdir {1..7}   . Using curl bracket makes multiple creation of directories possible. See also mkdir {a..f}, mkdir {A..Z}, mkdir Project{1..4}
        
####  Now list all the directories created: 
        ls -l

### Task 4: Working with `echo` command 


    echo I am your tutor
    echo "I am your tutor"
    echo "which directory am I?"
    echo "you are in $(pwd) directory" 
    echo -e "which directory am I? \n You are in `pwd` directory"
    echo -e "Even Linux is good with color...  \033[32mGreen\033[m and \033[41mRed(underlined)\033[m and \033[0;36mCyan\033[m ..."

### Task 5:  Direct each of the commands above to a file 


    echo I am your tutor > file1.txt
    echo "I am your tutor" > file2.txt
    echo "which directory am I?" > file3.txt
    echo "you are in $(pwd) directory" > file4.txt 

### Task 6: view the content of the file(s) with `cat` `more` and `less` commands   


    cat file1.txt
    cat file1.txt file2.txt
    cat *.txt

    more file3.txt
    less file3.txt

### Task 7: Merge all the files created into one mega file . Call it mega.txt. Check the content

    cat *.txt >> mega.txt
    cat mega.txt

### Task 8: Working with file copying, renaming/moving and deleting files and directories 

- copy mega.txt to a new file called database.db
- delete mega.txt
- rename file1.txt to firstfile.txt
- move all the .txt files to Jan directory
- rename Jan directory to January 
- copy January directory to February 
- delete Feb directory 

#### copy mega.txt to a new file called database.db
     cp mega.txt database.db

#### Delete meg.txt
     rm mega.txt 

#### Rename file1.txt to firstfile.txt
     mv  file1.txt firstfile.txt

#### Move all the .txt files to Jan directory
     mv *.txt Jan

#### Rename Jan directory to January directory
     mv Jan January . You could also use mv Jan{,uanry}

#### Copy January directory February
     cp -r January February 

#### Delete Feb directory
    rm -rf Feb
---


### Task 9: Install a webserver on the Frontend node and test you are able to access it  [ you may try with HTTPD or NGINX ]
     sudo yum install httpd  [ answer yes to installation request]
     sudo systemctl start httpd [ to start the web server]
     curl http://localhost to test  the web server is running. You could als try curl http://the_ip_address of the node
     update  machine security group to make the web server accessible over the net
     test 

### Task 10: Lock down access to the box and web-server to be only accessible by you
     update  machine security group. change inbound to your home/custom IP.




### Ex1: Can you update this to use https instead og http protocol?
### Ex2: Can you set this up as your website using AWS Route53?
